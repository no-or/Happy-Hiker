# Happy-Hiker
# An android app, completely developed by myself for one of my group projects, Happy Hiker.

-> Google Authentication integration

-> Firebase database integration

-> Arduino “device ID” allows the user to view previous
location history from our device (extracts data
from Firebase) and highlights the user’s most recent location

-> The App asks the user to complete a form (age, height etc.) and save it to the
Firebase for Park Ranger

# A demo of the app is on the repo
